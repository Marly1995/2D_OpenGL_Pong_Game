== 2D My First Triangle
:toc:
:!numbered:

=== Summary

This example just renders a single, white triangle on a red background every frame.

It is, more or less, the most simple OpenGL 3.3 program.

We'll get the source, build it, then do some <<Activities,activities>> to strengthen our understanding. It is important to get through all these activities. If you get through them there are also some <<Stretch Activities, stretch activities>>.

=== Activities

* You can do these in any order.
* You may want to make a new git branch for these
* Try to answer the questions for each also

//

. Make the background colour different
  .. *Questions*
    ... Which part of the code controls this?
    ... What language is it?
    ... How is the colour represented?
  .. Blue
  .. Green
  .. Black
  .. Yellow


. Make the triangle a different colour
  .. *Questions*
    ... Which part of the code controls this?
    ... What language is it?
  .. Purple
  .. Orange


. Make the triangle change colour on a keypress
  .. *Questions*
    ... Which part of the code controls this? Where is triangle colour set?
    ... How do you specify the key?
        How do you pass information to where it is needed?
    .. Make it change just once
    .. Make it change each time the key is pressed

. Add details to the console text
  .. *Questions*
    ... Where is text created?
    ... Where is the text written to the console?
    ... How does it change the text?
    ... Where else can this text be created?
  .. add how long the frame took to render
  .. add the frames per second
  .. make the frames per second an average over a few frames [stretch]

. Make the triangle colour change over time
  .. *Questions*
    ... How do you know the time?
    ... Do you pass in the time, or a color? Does it matter?
  .. make the colour start at black, and get more red, forever
  .. make the colour start at black, go fully red, go back to black, and repeat

. Make the triangle have different colours for each of its points
  .. Each "vertex" presently has position information
  .. We want color information for each vertex also
  .. *Questions*
    ... Where is this information in our C++;
    ... Where is this extra information needed?
    ... How to you get this extra information to that point?
      .... What happens to the information between these stages?
    ... How do you specify that extra information?
  .. Make the three vertices Red, Green, and Blue

=== Stretch Activities

. Print the colour of the triangle to the console
. Make the colour of the triangle controlled by the mouse
  .. in any way
  .. with the x-axis controlling the "hue" and the y-axis the "brightness" - or something similar
  .. only when a mouse button is pressed
