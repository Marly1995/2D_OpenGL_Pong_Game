The open nature of this book is partially inspired by Robert Nystrom's excellent http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/[Game Programming Patterns]

## Getting example code

* clone the repository recursively (to also pull down the dependencies)

[source, bash]
----
git clone --recursive https://github.com/shearer12345/graphicsByExample.git
----

* OR fork the repository on github and clone it from your repository
  ** you may want to then make your repository private

## Example code

* each example is complete and in a separate git branch
  ** allowing you to `diff` between branches to see what has changed
* the `master` branch composes all the example branches together for rapid demonstrations/explorations
* all examples are in C++11, using modern OpenGL
* all examples are cross-platform (Windows, Linux, OS X)

## Building examples

* we use https://premake.github.io/index.html[premake5] to build solutions and projects
  ** Visual Studio 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015
  ** Make
  ** Xcode4
  ** MonoDevelop

* to build, in the root of the repository, run:
